>THERE IS NO GOING BACK!

But you don't have any reasons to go back, do you?

## For general security:

* Use `uBlock Origin` extension on your browser.
* Block tracking and malware domains using [Dan Pollock's hosts file](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/). This has the upside of working on all software on your computer, not just Web browsers.
* Don't fiddle with shady things you find on the internet without being sure. (Things like this one :trollface:)
* In case you really need an antivirus, just use avast free version and you'll be good.
